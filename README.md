# vanillaJS-HTML
This repo contains vanilla JS/HTML implementations of various routine components -- like a menu of US Staters -- that can be easily incorporated into your code.

The purpose here is to create a library of usable HTLM/JS code bits that any coder can cut and paste into her or his work.  
(They're not snippets, they're just a bit too long, and do require thinking).

These files have no dependencies and require no links to CDNs or incorproation of framework elements.  


# Listing of Files
